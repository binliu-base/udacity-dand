# Univariate Plots Section

The first thing I analyzed was the financial stability of Prosper business. How their business was growing and were there any ups and downs between 2005 and 2014. Let’s see how are loans distributed over the years.


```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

                      Amount = LoanOriginalAmount) %>%
               group_by(Quarter) %>%
               summarise(Loans = n()/ 10 ^ 3, 
                         Dollars = sum(Amount)/ 10 ^ 6) %>%

               filter(Quarter < "2014")

```
The chart in the annual report began in the third quarter of 2009. The period of October 15, 2008 to July 13, 2009 is known as Prosper’s Quiet Period (http://www.lendacademy.com/a-look-back-at-the-lending-club-andprosper-quiet-periods/) when they were required to suspend lending pending SEC approval. When they relaunched in July 2009, there were several changes to their lending process, so I’ll have to keep that in mind.

**Why people use Prosper?**

```{r  warning=FALSE}
## 6.
x <- qplot(CreditScore, data = fulldf, xlim = c(300, 850))

```

Credit scores range from 300 to 850.  Prosper borrower have a median score of `r median(fulldf$CreditScore)`, which is considered good credit.  Prosper now requires a minimum credit score of 640 for new borrowers or 600 for returning borrowers, but initially, subprime borrowers could also apply for loans.

```

**How the Debt to Income is distributed?**

```{r echo=FALSE, "How the Debt to Income is distributed"}
## 11.
ggplot(aes(x = DebtToIncomeRatio), 
       data = subset(fulldf, DebtToIncomeRatio < 1)) +

# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
    
The ProsperLoan dataset contains `r nrow(fulldf)` loans and 81 variables. The loans cover the period `r range(fulldf$LoanOriginationDate)`.  Variables are of classes int, numeric, date, and factor.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
There are two domain in the ProsperLoan model. Domain one is company domain (one role: Prosper), Domain two is customer domain (tow role: Investor and borrower).

As a business, Prosper would be most concerned with LP_ServiceFees and LP_CollectionFees, which form their primary revenue source.

The main feature of the borrowers is ProsperRating, which is based on their credit score and history with Prosper loans.

For investors, the main features are the LenderYield (interest rate minus the service fee) and the LP_NetPrincipalLoss, which is the principal that remains uncollected after any recoveries.


### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

Other variables that can help me to support my investigation are Debt To Income Ratio, Occupation, Employment Status and 
Employment Duration.


### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I created two new variables, The first is CreditScore, which is average number of the CreditScoreRangeUpper and CreditScoreRangeLower variables.  Another is a factor variable Results, which simplify each loans status as "Current or Paid", "Past Due", or "Defaulted". 

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

There is a high decrease of the number of the loans between the fourth quarter of 2008 and 
The fourth quarter of 2009. Cause is  Prosper's business model came under scrutiny by the US Securities and Exchange Commission at that time. If I was not aware of the event, this would be a unusual distributions.
